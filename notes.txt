NOTES: Switching from Hardcoded Absolute Path to sys.argv
=========================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- Removed hardcoded absolute path (e.g., "/home/phoenix/books/frankenstein.txt")
- Now using sys.argv[1] to accept the book path as a command-line argument

WHY THIS MATTERS:

1. Portability
   - Hardcoded paths only work on one specific machine
   - Other developers have different directory structures
   - Code would fail for anyone else cloning the repo

2. Flexibility
   - Can analyze ANY book without modifying code:
     python3 main.py books/frankenstein.txt
     python3 main.py books/moby_dick.txt
     python3 main.py /any/path/to/book.txt

3. Boot.dev Testing
   - Automated tests need to supply their own test files
   - Hardcoded paths prevent tests from passing
   - Tests inject different inputs via command-line arguments

4. Professional Standard Practice
   - CLI tools accept input via arguments, not hardcoded values
   - Makes the tool reusable and configurable
   - No code edits needed to change input

HOW IT WORKS NOW (main.py):
---------------------------
import sys

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Usage: python3 main.py <path_to_book>")
    sys.exit(1)

book_path = sys.argv[1]  # Gets the first argument after the script name

USAGE:
------
python3 main.py <path_to_book>

Example:
python3 main.py books/frankenstein.txt
